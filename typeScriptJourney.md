## Reflections

1. **Module 1**
   In the first module, I learned about TypeScript, what it is, and what it's used for. I got acquainted with how to install it on my computer and how to compile TypeScript files. Additionally, I completed basic exercises on setting up a TypeScript project.
2. **Module 2**
   In the second module, I familiarized myself with the basic types in TypeScript, particularly primitives. I completed several exercises and learned about the `any` and `unknown` types. Additionally, I learned about union and intersection types in TypeScript, as well as the collection type. I also completed a small lab assignment.
3. **Module 3**
   In the third module, I learned about interfaces in TypeScript, including how to declare and create instances of interfaces. I completed a small exercise on interfaces and also learned about other ways to use interfaces in TypeScript. Finally, there was a small lab assignment.
4. **Module 4**
   In the fourth module, I learned about functions in TypeScript, including the different types of functions that exist, the parameters they can accept. I completed several exercises, and there was also a small lab assignment at the end.
5. **Module 5**
   In the fifth module, I learned about classes in TypeScript, including how to create classes, instantiate them, and the various access modifiers available. I completed several exercises and learned about static class properties, inheritance, and completed additional exercises. At the end, there was a small lab assignment.
6. **Module 6**
   In the sixth module, I learned about generics in TypeScript. I explored various ways to use generic types, including implementing generics with interfaces and classes. I learned how to implement generics with custom types and classes, and completed several exercises. At the end, there was a small lab assignment.
7. **Module 7**
   In the seventh module, I learned how to organize code using modules in TypeScript. I learned about import and export statements, compilation of modules, and completed a small lab assignment. Additionally, I completed several exercises on exporting and importing module components.
8. **Module 8**
   In the final module, I learned about namespaces in DALL Script, how to organize code using separate namespace files, and completed several exercises. I read the design recommendation, completed a lab assignment, and several small exercises. With this, my basic introduction to transcript within the Microsoft course came to an end.
