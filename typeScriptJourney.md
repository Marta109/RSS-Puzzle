## Reflections
1. **Module 1**
In the first module, I learned about TypeScript, what it is, and what it's used for. I got acquainted with how to install it on my computer and how to compile TypeScript files. Additionally, I completed basic exercises on setting up a TypeScript project.
2. **Module 2**
In the second module, I familiarized myself with the basic types in TypeScript, particularly primitives. I completed several exercises and learned about the `any` and `unknown` types. Additionally, I learned about union and intersection types in TypeScript, as well as the collection type. I also completed a small lab assignment.
3. **Module 3**
In the third module, I learned about interfaces in TypeScript, including how to declare and create instances of interfaces. I completed a small exercise on interfaces and also learned about other ways to use interfaces in TypeScript. Finally, there was a small lab assignment.
4. **Module 4**
In the fourth module, I learned about functions in TypeScript, including the different types of functions that exist, the parameters they can accept. I completed several exercises, and there was also a small lab assignment at the end.
